<h2>Loading on Demand</h2>

<p>
    If a tree could potentially contain a large number of items and the user would likely only open a small number
    of folders, the children of a node can be loaded on demand via a callback function.  The function is passed the
    ID of the node.  It performs the necessary work to fetch and/or construct the child data then updates the array
    passed to <code>DuxTree</code>.
</p>

<p>
    A few properties in the data array control on-demand loading.  The <code>onLoadChildren</code> property specifies
    the callback function.  The <code>loadingMsg</code> property contains a string or JSX component to display while
    the data is being loaded.  The default is "Loading...".  The <code>isLoading</code> property is true while the
    data is being loaded.
