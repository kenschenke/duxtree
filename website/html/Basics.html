<h2>DuxTree Basics</h2>

<p>
    Here is a very basic tree.  <code>DuxTree</code> offers several options not demonstrated here, but this should
    give you an idea of what kind of tree can be shown.  In this example, the user can choose their pizza toppings.
    Notice there are a few toppings selected by default.</p>

<p>
    The checkboxes next to Meats and Veggies indicate that some, but not all, options in those folders are selected.
    Clicking those checkboxes selects or un-selects all children in a folder.
