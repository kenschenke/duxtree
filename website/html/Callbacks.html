<h2>Callbacks</h2>

<p>
    <code>DuxTree</code> supports some optional callbacks at the tree level and the node level.
</p>

<h4>DuxTree Callbacks</h4>

<p>
    These callbacks are at the tree level so they are passed as properties to the <code>DuxTree</code> component.
</p>

<h5>onExpand</h5>

<p>
    This is called when a folder is expanded by the user.  The ID of the node is passed to the callback.
    <strong>NOTE</strong>: if an onExpand callback is specified for the node, the tree-level callback is not called.
</p>

<h5>onCollapse</h5>

<p>
    This is called when a folder is collapsed by the user.  The ID of the code is passed to the callback.
    <strong>NOTE</strong>: if an onCollapse callback is specified for the node, the tree-level callback is not called.
</p>

<h5>onSelectionChanged</h5>

<p>
    This is called when the user checks or un-checks a node or a folder of nodes.  An array of the selected IDs is
    passed in.
</p>

<h4>Node Callbacks</h4>

<p>
    These callbacks are at the node level.  They are passed as properties of the node objects in the array
    passed to the <code>data</code> property of the <code>DuxTree</code> component.
</p>

<h5>onExpand</h5>

<p>
    This is called when a folder is expanded by the user.  The ID of the node is passed to the callback.
</p>

<h5>onCollapse</h5>

<p>
    This is called when a folder is collapsed by the user.  The ID of the code is passed to the callback.
</p>

<h5>onLoadChildren</h5>

<p>
    This is called when a folder is expanded by the user.  The ID of the node is passed to the callback.
